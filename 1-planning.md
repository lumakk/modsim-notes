# Project Planning 

**Project Management** is a methodical approach to identifying the cause of an incident and managing the life cycle of all problems 

**Project Manager (PM)** is a person whose organized, passionate and goal-oriented who understands what projects have in common, and their strategic role in how an organization succeeds, learns and changes. 

## Project Management Concepts 

1. **Project Parameters** - are they key defining factors that establish a project's boundaries, constraints, and success criteria. 
    * **Time Parameter** - is associated with the schedule, which is most frequently implemented as a **Gantt chart** - a horizontal bar chart on which each bar represents the sequence and duration of a different task in the project.
    * **Cost** - means that there is a budget associated with the project. 
    * **Performance** - the project statement is already specified in the early stage of the project. These objectives may require that the simulation model be used to make operational or capital investment decisions. The project must achieve these objectives in order to be considered successful from a technical performance standpoint.

2. **Project Life Cycle** - is a structured, multi-phase framework guiding a project from its inception to completion
    * **Conceptual** - The first phase, this involves the **initial decision** by someone in the organization to consider conducting the simulation study. The **problem formulation** process may be completed during this life cycle phase.  
    * **Planning** - During this phase, the project manager will identify all of the project team members. The simulation-planning process activities involving the work breakdown structure, linear responsibility chart, and a Gantt chart are conducted during this phase.
        * Breakdown structure - what are the tasks that are needed to do? 
        * Linear Responsibility Chart - Who are the people that is needed for the project?
        * Gantt Chart - What is the schedule?
    * **Execution** - Most of the simulation project activities will be completed during this phase. These include the system definition, input data collection and analysis, model translation, verification, validation, experimentation, and analysis. 
    * **Completion** - Activities in this phase are normally conducted after most of the technical project activities have been concluded. These activities are associated with turning over the results of the project and primarily incldue the simulation project report and presentation activities. 

3. **Project Stakeholders** - are individuals or organizations who have some sort of vested interest in the ongoing operations and completion of the project.
    * **Internal Stakeholders** - individuals who are **directly** associated with the simulation project team. For example, the Project Manager, Analysts, Statisticians, Data collectors
    * **External Stakeholders** - individuals or organizations who are **not directly** associated with the simulation project team. For example, software vendors, regulatory agencies, competitors.

## Project Manager Functions 

1. **Planning** - The PM must ensure that a proper and effective plan for the simulation project is in place. This process includes the development of a work breakdown structure and a Gantt chart. 
2. **Organizing** - Involves identifying, acquiring, and aligning the simulation project team. 
3. **Motivating** - Involves motivating the simulation project team. By ensuring that the project team is highly motivated, the project manager has a greater probability of completing a successful simulation project .
4. **Directing** - can be particularly difficult because of the nature of the practitioner's relationship with other individuals who may be involved in the project .
    * **Authority** - is defined as the power to command others to act or not to act. There are two types of authority: **De jure** - gives the project manager the legal power to acquire and utilize organization resources, **De facto** - depends on other individuals complying out of respect for the individual's unique knowledge or skill. 
5. **Controlling** - consists of setting project standards, observing performance, comparing the observed performance with the project standards and taking corrective action. 

## Ways to Plan a Simulation Project 

1. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** - is a successively lower division of project tasks into subtasks. 
2. **Linear Responsibility Chart (LRC)** - shows who participates in each activity and to what degree. It shows who is involved in each task. The last step before starting a project is to create a linear responsibility chart -- also called a **responsibility matrix** -- that identifies who is responsible for core project activities, actions and decisions. The responsibility assignment matrix or **RACI tool** alerts project stakeholders to the team members who are assigned particular to project responsibilities. 
    * **RACI Role designation**
        * **R = Responsible (also recommender)** - those who do the work to complete the task. There is at least one role with a participation type of responsibility. 
        * **A = Accountable (also approver or final approving authority)** - the one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task. 
        * **C = Consulted (Sometimes consultant or counsel)** - those whose opinions are sought, typically subject-matter experts.
        * **I = Informed (Also informee)** - those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of task or deliverable.

Other alternatives to RACI involve: **PARIS** and **PACSI**

3. **Gantt Chart** - illustrates the durations and relationships among different project activities. 

## Project Estimation 

**Project Estimation** - is a consistent process of estimating a project through data analysis and refining to design a project estimate which represents an approximate calculation of the quantity or worth of the project. It is the way to investigate wheter a given project is worth initiation.

There are two ways to estimate a project:
1. **Three Point Estimation** - is a technique that utilizes an optimistic and a pessimistic estimate to deterime the ideal estimate value for a project task. It involves three formulas:
    * **Triangular Distribution** - involves a simple average of three values: `E = (a + m + b) / 3`, where `E` is the estimated cost, `a` is the optimistic value, `m` is the most likeley value and `b` is the most pessimistic value.
    * **Beta Distribution** - places the final estimate closer to the most likely value: `E = (a + 4m + b) / 6`
    * **Scale Parameters:**
        * **Optimistic:** Assuming the risks do not occur.
        * **Most likely:** Assuming the risk occurrence level that is most likely to occur.
        * **Pessimistic:** Assuming that the risks occur. 

2. **Fibonacci Agile Estimation** - refers to a way of quantifying the effort needed to complete a development task. Many agile teams use story points as the unit to score their tasks. The higher the number of points, the more effort the team believes the task will take. 

The Fibonacci sequence goes as: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`. It refers to using this sequence as the scoring scale when estimating the effort of agile development tasks.
